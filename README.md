# skin disease prediction system
 This project implements a Skin Disease Prediction System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. It leverages a deep learning model to classify images of skin diseases into predefined categories. The system includes a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio for real-time predictions.
